    <h1>Usain Bolt</h1>

    <h4>
      Usain Bolt, in full Usain St. Leo Bolt, (born August 21, 1986, Montego
      Bay, Jamaica), Jamaican sprinter who won gold medals in the 100-metre and
      200-metre races in an unprecedented three straight Olympic Games and is
      widely considered the greatest sprinter of all time.

      <p>
        At age 16 Bolt cut the junior (age 19 and under) 200-metre world record
        to 20.13 sec, and at 17 he ran the event in 19.93 sec, becoming the
        first teenager to break 20 seconds in the race. However, hampered by a
        hamstring injury, he failed to advance beyond the 200-metre heats at the
        2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece, and placed last in the 2005 world
        track-and-field championships final. At 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 metres),
        Bolt defied the conventional wisdom that very tall sprinters are
        disadvantaged as fast starters. In 2007 he appeared newly dedicated to
        his training and earned a silver medal in the 200 metres at the world
        championships. He also persuaded his coach to let him try the 100
        metres, and he ran 10.03 sec in his first professional race at the
        distance. On May 3, 2008, he lowered his best time to 9.76 sec, then the
        worldâ€™s second fastest mark. Four weeks later in New York City, Bolt
        broke the world record, running 9.72 sec to defeat world champion Tyson
        Gay.
